### Research path
I have a bachelor degree in Biology from Brazil at [Unila](https://portal.unila.edu.br/) and I am currently doing my PhD in Quebec with [Hugo Germain](http://www.germainhugo.com/) and [Isabel Desgagne-Penix](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3466) at [UQTR](http:/uqtr.ca) on **_Transcriptomics and metabolomics of Arabidopsis in response to fungal virulence proteins_**. 

Although my PhD program is in Cellular and molecular biology, I did all the analyses of my transcriptomic data and currently on my metabolomic data and I have collaborated in other projects throughout my PhD doing _de novo_ transcriptome assembly, annotation and differential exon usage.

In 2018, I did an internship at [Peter Solomon's lab](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/peter-solomon) with [Megan McDonald](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/megan-mcdonald), where I used MinIon to sequence the genome of several isolates of the fungus _Bipolaris sorokiniana_, basecalled the reads and assembled them and finally aligned the new genomes to a reference to study structural changes in the chromosomes.

I also developed a R package for selection of reference genes from transcriptomic data (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6426-2).

### Research path

I am a biotechnology engineer with concentration in molecular biology, I obtained my degree at [ITESM](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico. Nowadays, I am doing my Master degree in Quebec at [UQTR](https://www.uqtr.ca/informationgenerale/english.shtml) with [Isabel Desgagné-Penix](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3466) as supervisor, working on __*The Characterization of Vanillin Synthase in a model diatom*__. 

I am expecting to do a fast track to PhD to work on __*Transcriptomics of engineered microalgae*__, eventhough the program is in molecular and cellular biology, I will do the analysis of my data. 

I have worked with metagenomics data to asign taxonomy to microbial populations from environmental samples in Mexico, analize
