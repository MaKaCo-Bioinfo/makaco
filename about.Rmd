I have a bachelor degree in Biology from Brazil at [Unila](https://portal.unila.edu.br/) and I am currently doing my PhD in Quebec with [Hugo Germain](http://www.germainhugo.com/) and [Isabel Desgagne-Penix](https://oraprdnt.uqtr.uquebec.ca/pls/public/gscw031?owa_no_site=3466) at [UQTR](http:/uqtr.ca) on **_Transcriptomics and metabolomics of Arabidopsis in response to fungal virulence proteins_**. 

Although my PhD program is in Cellular and molecular biology, I did all the analyses of my transcriptomic data and currently on my metabolomic data and I have collaborated in other projects throughout my PhD doing _de novo_ transcriptome assembly, annotation and differential exon usage.

In 2018, I did an internship at [Peter Solomon's lab](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/peter-solomon) with [Megan McDonald](https://biology.anu.edu.au/people/academics/megan-mcdonald), where I used MinIon to sequence the genome of several isolates of the fungus _Bipolaris sorokiniana_, basecalled the reads and assembled them and finally aligned the new genomes to a reference to study structural changes in the chromosomes.

I also developed a R package for selection of reference genes from transcriptomic data (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-6426-2).
